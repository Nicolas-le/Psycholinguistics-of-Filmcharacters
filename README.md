# The Personality of Gangsters

## Web App - Researching Quentin Tarantino’s Character Design with the Use of Computer Based Psycholinguistic Analysis.

This Repo documents the web application of a research concerning the automated analysis of film scripts.
The app is meant to be a visualization of the outcome and a tool for own questions and researches.




> **2.6 Web-App and database**
>The web application was created by using “flask”, “HTML” and “CSS”, “d3”, “jquery” and “plotly”. Concerning the displayed graph, the edges are drawn in relation to the weight. The main feature is built by the underlying relational database which is filled with all the data generated as explained above. Database tables are for example “film”, “character”, “charts”, “network results” etc. The whole database and the app are coded to sustain the extensibility of the database.

> EN: This work was realized as part of the course "Drama Mining und Film-Analyse" (summer semester 2019) under the supervision of Manuel Burghardt and Jochen Tiepmar at the University of Leipzig.
